          <p>I'm a seasoned consultant with many years of experience in software development. Even though my educational background is from the more business-savy world, my main interest was always the technical side, and building things. This has lead me on the path of IT consultancy - Assisting teams with delivering great IT solutions.</p>

          <p>My expertise spans across the .NET ecosystem, Azure cloud platform, and modern application development. I specialize in enterprise architecture and software engineering, with additional experience in Angular development. Throughout my career, I've worked extensively with financial institutions and legal-oriented government institutions, delivering robust and secure solutions that meet complex regulatory requirements.</p>

          <p>What I love most about being a consultant is the opportunity to work on diverse projects, solve challenging problems, and continuously learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.</p>

          <p>I've had roles as architect for maintaining and developing legacy systems, acted as architect on a discovery project, as a developer taking PoCs to production and assisting with migrating clients from one hosting provider to the cloud.</p>

          <p>So, are you looking for an IT profile with plenty of experience within the world of .Net, Windows and Azure? Well, look no further!</p>
